2 hashes are generated, 1 public(static) and 1 private(unique to each user) shown during access of blockchain.
On creation of every block a new private hash is assigned to the user that is required to access the block. If the hash is correct on both sides 
then the blockchain can be accessed. every hash is generated randomly when user logins.
